# Client-Server
Small project to learn socket programming and sending files. There is client and server side bit with main functions. You need to run them 
seperately. So far its only client side that is sending files and server sides accepting them. When you run client side it will ask you to 
input the IP you want to connect to. Default setting is localhost. After setting the IP you will be asked to provide path to file. Once you 
input file path it will send the file automaticly if it exist. The application will terminate after sending 1 file. It can be all easily 
changed to send more files.
